This is a Program designed to run in Python!!
It requires the installation of pandas, and mysql-connector. 
You will need to make a seperate files called DataBaseLogInfo that
records the sensitive information required to connect to a Database.

You should first begin by running the FlightDBQuery file as it is the main file
Then you should totally look at the code for it so you can see queries in action!!

Once you feel comfortable with that, go ahead and run DataBaseConnect so you
can play around with the different queries!!
